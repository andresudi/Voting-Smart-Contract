# Voting System Smart Contract
Electronic voting systems have replaced paper-based systems, but even now, people doubt the
voting system’s ability to secure the data and defend against any attacks. The blockchain-based
system can ensure transparent and publicly verifiable elections in the country. If implemented
successfully, voting can be done using a mobile application that is attached to a blockchain
system.

## Feature
```
● The owner of the contract can input one or more choices to be voted by people.
● The owner of the contract can specify the start time and end time for the voting period.
● A voter can vote for any choices set by the contract owner during the voting period.
● A voter can only vote once during the voting period.
● The smart contract can return the number of votes for each choice.
● Anyone can set up a voting system through the same smart contract.
